# Accounting Ledger App
This app helps users organize and track their information, including both payments and deposits. Usercs can quickly add transactions to a csv file, including details like date, time, description, vendor, and amount. The Ledger App shows a full list of transactions and lets users filter to view only payments or only deposits. It also includes a reporting feature that allows users to view transactions within specific date ranges or search by vendor name.
